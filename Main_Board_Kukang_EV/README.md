This is a program from the 'Kukang Electric Vehicle' Main Board, which functions as a monitor and controller for several parts within the Electric Vehicle system. The program aims to optimize the performance of the electric vehicle by monitoring various critical parameters such as temperature, voltage, current, speed, gyroscope, accelerometer, and GPS. Additionally, the program can control specific components, such as brake pedal settings or ESC and motor cooling adjustments. The data collected by this Main Board is then transmitted wirelessly using LoRa telemetry technology with a frequency of 915 MHz. This allows users to remotely monitor and control the Electric Vehicle and assists in efficiently analyzing and improving the vehicle's performance.
